; Wannabe generic C65-mode loader for MEGA65: the loader/"basic stub"
;
; This file (with the Makefile too) also functions as an intended example
; for M65 development, using C65 mode loader, and Xemu to test (see Makefile)
; during the development. Please feel free to contant me with suggested
; modifications, it's higly onl a try&error method to do something useful.
; This is also a reason this source is "over-commented".

	; It's set the BANK number, with the extension that +128 means the "BASIC configuration" (I/O, etc)
	; However according to my tests, it's not true. Using BANK 128 here, still does not work. What I can
	; found only for a sane C65 loader is using BANK 0 before SYS, and doing all the memory MAP, etc then
	; in machine code for the desired mode. I will do that, in routine init_system, see later.
